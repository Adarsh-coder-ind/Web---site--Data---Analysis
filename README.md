 Website Data Analysis – Extended Introduction
1. Project Purpose & Context
This analysis aims to uncover actionable insights from web traffic data to inform marketing strategy and enhance user engagement. It’s designed for website owners, digital marketers, and data analysts who want to understand:

Who is visiting the site and when

How different traffic sources perform in terms of engagement

What patterns or trends emerge over time that could guide optimization efforts

By interpreting user behavior and traffic channel effectiveness, this project helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions to boost website performance and conversion.

2. Dataset Overview
Source: Exported from a web analytics platform (e.g., Google Analytics)

Key dimensions:

session_date, user_id, traffic_channel (Direct, Organic Search, Referral, Paid Social, etc.)

Key metrics:

sessions, users, avg_session_duration, pages_per_session, bounce_rate

3. Analytical Objectives
Temporal Trends

Track how sessions and active users change over time (daily, weekly, monthly).

Identify peak traffic periods and assess seasonality or anomalies.

Channel Comparison

Rank traffic channels by volume, engagement, and retention metrics.

Evaluate which channels are delivering the most valuable users.

Engagement Analysis

Compare average session durations and pages per session across channels.

Highlight channels with stronger stickiness or lower bounce rates.

Correlation & Patterns

Investigate relationships between variables (e.g., session duration and pages per session).

Surface insights such as “traffic from paid social has higher bounce rate” or “organic search brings longer sessions”.

4. Tools & Workflow
Data processing using Pandas and NumPy

Visualization via Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Line charts for temporal trends

Bar plots for channel performance

Scatter plots and heatmaps for correlation analysis

Data cleaning steps include handling missing values, date formatting, and channel grouping.

5. Expected Deliverables
Visual report: Charts illustrating key findings and channel performance summaries

Insights & recommendations:

Identifying best-performing channels

Proposing optimization strategies (e.g., invest more in high-retention channels, improve low-performing ones)
